# NumPy_Tutorials
This repository is a compilation of my personal learnings and code samples for the NumPy library. 

Here's my learnings:
I have gained a solid understanding of the basics of the NumPy library. I have learned how to create NumPy arrays, including one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and multi-dimensional arrays. I now understand how to use indexing and slicing techniques to extract specific elements or subsets of an array. Additionally, I have learned how to perform various mathematical operations on NumPy arrays, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I have also gained a good understanding of NumPy's statistical functions, which allow me to perform calculations such as mean, standard deviation, and variance on large datasets. Finally, I have learned how to perform linear algebra operations using NumPy, such as matrix multiplication, dot products, and eigenvalue calculations. Overall, I now have a strong foundation in the NumPy library and now I can  work with large datasets and perform numerical computations using Python.
